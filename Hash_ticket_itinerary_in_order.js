/*
A starting point would never be on â€˜toâ€™ side of a ticket.
Once we find the starting point, we can simply traverse the given map to print itinerary in order.
 Following are steps.

1) Create a HashMap of given pair of tickets.  Let the created
   HashMap be 'dataset'. Every entry of 'dataset' is of the form
   "from->to" like "Chennai" -> "Banglore"

2) Find the starting point of itinerary.
     a) Create a reverse HashMap.
        Let the reverse be 'reverseMap'
        Entries of 'reverseMap' are of the form "to->form".
        Following is 'reverseMap' for above example.
        "Banglore"-> "Chennai"
        "Delhi"   -> "Bombay"
        "Chennai" -> "Goa"
        "Goa"     ->  "Delhi"

     b) Traverse 'dataset'.  For every key of dataset, check if it
        is there in 'reverseMap'.  If a key is not present, then we
        found the starting point. In the above example, "Bombay" is
        starting point.

3) Start from above found starting point and traverse the 'dataset'
   to print itinerary.

All of the above steps require O(n) time so overall time complexity is O(n).
